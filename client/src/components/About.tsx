          Hi, I'm Lauren! Ever since I can remember, I've been obsessed with
          fashion. My mom was a fashion queen & she instilled in me the
          importance of always looking put together. She taught me fashion is
          about having fun, taking risks, the importance of a sale! We spent
          late nights making Fashion Island and South Coast Plaza runs when I
          should have been doing my homework. For me, when I love what I'm
          wearing, I feel unstoppable. That feeling when you're getting showered
          in compliments, that's the feeling I wanted to encompass with SBS. I'm
          no stranger to weddings (let us forget my stint as a â€œBridal
          Stylist!), bachelorette parties, black tie events etc.! I know how
          overwhelming it can be to dial in outfits! I wanted to create specific
          packages, to tailor it down and make the styling process really fun &
          seamless! Nothing makes me happier than pulling together looks and
          watching it all come to life piece by piece! With endless years of
          styling practice, I am so thrilled to watch my passion come to life!
