          Hi, I'm Lauren! Ever since I can remember, I've been obsessed with
          fashion. My mom was a fashion queen! She showed me the importance of
          always looking put together, and that with the perfect shoes and
          accessories, you don't need much else. She taught me fashion is about
          having fun, taking risks, the importance of a sale! We spent late
          nights making Fashion Island and South Coast Plaza runs when I should
          have been doing my homework. For me, when I love what I'm wearing, I
          feel UNSTOPPABLE. That feeling when you're getting showered in
          compliments and you're like “Oh, I know, honey!” I wanted to create
          that feeling with SBS. I'm no stranger to weddings (let us forget my
          stint as a “Bridal Stylist!), bachelorette parties, black tie events
          etc.! I wanted to create specific packages, to tailor it down and make
          it really seamless! Nothing makes me happier than pulling together
          looks and watching it all come to life piece by piece! With endless
          years of styling practice, I am so thrilled to watch my passion come
          to life!
